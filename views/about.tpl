<h3>Within Temptation</h3>

<p>
    Within Temptation has come a long way in the last nineteen years.
    Two members, Robert and Jeroen, started out in a band called 'The Cirlce'. Though after they left the band, it soon
    fell apart. Robert and Jeroen continued to form 'The Portal', along with Robert's girlfriend (current wife) Sharon den Adel.
    Though the band already had a logo, they changed the name of the band to 'Within Temptation' before releasing their first songs.
    And so, from their humble beginnings in 1996, the Dutch band has now sold over 3.0 million CDs and DVDs world-wide,
    making them not only Holland’s biggest selling musical export but also one of the biggest rock acts internationally.
    They started in 1996 with guitarist Robert Westerholt and vocalist Sharon den Adel, and eventually
    released their debut album “Enter”. Seventeen years later they’ve released their latest album: Hydra.
